# project_predict_house_price

In this project firstly, I did some data cleaning, and data visualization. Then I built statistical models based on the past sale data and the relative predictors. And I used the models to predict the house sale price with the test data. When I am building the models, I tried to find which predictor has relationship with house price, what is the relationship between the predictor. The purpose to estimate f is both prediction and inference.
From the models’ comparison, KNN (k=1) is the best model to predict the house price. It means: if you want to estimate a house’s sale price, try to find a sold house which is similar.
