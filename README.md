# project_predict_house_price
House price is always a hot topic. When you are hunting for house, you will spend a huge amount of money. You may deposit for a long time to make the down payment and you need to make a loan for 30 years. So that’s why the house price is very important and sensitive. For your future dream house, expected relax place, and a feasible payment plan, to estimate the house price ahead of time is helpful. But when you are reviewing the information of the house, a lot of parameters(predictors) appear. As the common sense, the street(location), lot size is the most important predictors. How about the others?  
In this project firstly, I did some data cleaning, and data visualization. Then I built statistical models based on the past sale data and the relative predictors. And I used the models to predict the house sale price with the test data. When I am building the models, I tried to find which predictor has relationship with house price, what is the relationship between the predictor. The purpose to estimate f is both prediction and inference.
From the models’ comparison, KNN (k=1) is the best model to predict the house price. It means: if you want to estimate a house’s sale price, try to find a sold house which is similar.
